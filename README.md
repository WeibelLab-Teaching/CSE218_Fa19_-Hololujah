CookAR is a project aimed at providing a faster and better cooking experience for everyday lives. Essentially, this is done by using an open source cooking recipe database in the backend, approved for our use by the very kind #Tab Atkins# and a Unity Frontend. 

### Why CookAR? 
One-third of all food produced is wasted, and traditional challenges with cooking such as lack of recipes to select from, indecision on what to cook, dirty hands and distractions that can prove to be deadly still exist. Therefore, here we look at a way to alleviate these chaklenges by using a AR application used on the Microsoft Hololens I. 

The most important use of CookAR is reduction of time with finding an interesting/appropriate recipe and following traditional mediums of information for recipes.

### What does CookAR do?
CookAR helps reduces recipe lookup times by providing users with a range of recipe options that decreases the recipe selection time, using three different usecases:-

* Selecting a recipe while looking at the entire database of options
* Selecting a recipe using text based search, from this list to display to the user
* Providing the user with one random recipe to quickly cook 

Also, with each dish, once it is selected we have a interface that helps view instructions and a video to understand the process, and quickly make this recipe.
